WinCraft is a Windows tuning toolbox focused on system configuration and everyday usability improvements.

The project is still in an early scaffold stage. The repository already contains the multi-target build pipeline, release workflow, and compatibility layer, while the end-user feature set is still being built out.

## 📜 History

WinCraft continues the work of [ContextMenuManager](https://github.com/BluePointLilac/ContextMenuManager)
under a new account and name.  The original repository became unmaintainable
after I lost access to my 2FA credentials.

> 😤 GitHub 2FA: great at keeping attackers out, even better at keeping
> the [original author](https://github.com/BluePointLilac/ContextMenuManager/commits/master) out.
> Those commits are my pre-AI badge of honor.

### Installer (recommended)

| Format | File | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | [WinCraft-Setup.exe](https://github.com/YeahOSS/WinCraft/releases/latest/download/WinCraft-Setup.exe) | Interactive install, personal use |

See [docs/installer-guide.md](docs/installer-guide.md) for deployment commands.

- **Automatic .NET Framework adaptation.** Detects the installed .NET Framework version at install time: prefers `net45` when .NET 4.5+ is available, falls back to `net30` for older built-in-framework systems.
- **Faster startup.** Files are deployed directly to disk with an optimized runtime configuration — no overlay decompression at launch.

### Portable

| Format | File | Target Framework | Supported Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | [WinCraft-Standard.exe](https://github.com/YeahOSS/WinCraft/releases/latest/download/WinCraft-Standard.exe) | .NET Framework 4.5 | Windows 8, 8.1, 10, 11 |
| Legacy | [WinCraft-Legacy.exe](https://github.com/YeahOSS/WinCraft/releases/latest/download/WinCraft-Legacy.exe) | .NET Framework 3.0 | Windows Vista, 7 |

> [!WARNING]
> Because WinCraft modifies Windows settings through system APIs, some antivirus or security products may raise false positives — particularly on older release lines where legacy framework heuristics are stricter.
>
> Add the WinCraft folder or executable to your security software allowlist before running it.
